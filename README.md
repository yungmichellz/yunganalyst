- **Operating Systems:** Windows Server, Linux (Ubuntu, Kali Linux)
- **Cybersecurity Concepts:** CIA Triad, Zero Trust, MITRE ATT&CK, Risk Assessment

## 🛡️ Projects & Experience
### 🔍 Penetration Testing Lab (Home Lab)
Set up a local penetration testing lab using VirtualBox with vulnerable machines (e.g., Metasploitable2, DVWA) and conducted internal attack simulations to understand privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration techniques.

### 🧪 Vulnerability Scanning Automation Script
Built a Python script to automate scanning of target hosts using Nmap and parsing the results for critical vulnerabilities. Incorporated logging and report generation.

### 🧰 Wireshark Traffic Analysis
Captured and analyzed network packets during simulated MITM attacks to detect credential leaks and malicious payloads. Applied filtering, stream analysis, and anomaly detection techniques.

### 🔐 Participation in Capture the Flag (CTF) Events
Competed in beginner-level CTF challenges involving cryptography, steganography, reverse engineering, and web exploitation. Notable platforms: TryHackMe, HackTheBox.

## 🏆 Achievements
- Completed **[coursera google cybersecurity course]** with practical assessments in threat detection and incident response.
- Ranked in the top 15% in a TryHackMe cybersecurity challenge involving real-world attack simulation.
- Built a script to scan and report weak SSH configurations for internal audits.

## 📚 Continuous Learning
- Currently deepening my understanding of SOC operations, malware analysis, and red teaming.
- Active on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **Hack The Box**, and **GitHub** for building and sharing tools/scripts.
- Reading materials: *The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook*, *Practical Malware Analysis*.
